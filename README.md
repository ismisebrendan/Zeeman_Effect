# Zeeman_Effect
The code and original data for the Zeeman effect experiment

**Note:** when running the data and python scripts should be in the same folder, otherwise the python scripts should be altered to accommodate the folders in which they and the data are placed.

The file funcs.py holds all the user-defined functions referenced across the different files.

The data in data_exp1_8.txt, data_exp1_15.txt and data_exp1_22.txt were collected on different dates for the same part of the experiment (8, 15 and 22 November respectively).
